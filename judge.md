# **WHAT WE EVALUATE**

**A COLLABORATION BETWEEN BNB CHAIN • YZI LABS**

BNB Chain’s judging framework is built around five pillars that define great Web3 projects:

1. **DESIGN & USABILITY**
2. **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION & CODE QUALITY**
3. **BNB CHAIN INTEGRATION & ECOSYSTEM FIT**
4. **INNOVATION & CREATIVITY**
5. **SUSTAINABILITY & MARKET POTENTIAL**

---

## **1. DESIGN & USABILITY**

*How your project feels and functions for users.*

| CRITERION | WHAT WE LOOK FOR | GOOD EXAMPLE (HIGH SCORE) | NEEDS IMPROVEMENT (LOW SCORE) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **User Journey Documentation** | Clear user flow diagrams in .md files (Mermaid / PlantUML) | Full flow chart showing interactions and improved UX vs existing tools | Missing or unclear user journey |
| **System Architecture** | Diagrams showing system components and interactions | Complete, labeled architecture with modules & data flow | Partial or missing diagram |

---

## **2. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION & CODE QUALITY**

*Your code should reflect best practices: clean, modular, and deployable.*

| CRITERION | WHAT WE LOOK FOR | GOOD EXAMPLE (HIGH SCORE) | NEEDS IMPROVEMENT (LOW SCORE) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Open Source Availability** | Public GitHub repo with proper license | Repository public and actively maintained | Private or missing |
| **License File** | Open-source license (MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL) | Clearly declared in LICENSE file | Missing or custom restrictive license |
| **Dependencies Section** | Credits and open-source dependencies listed | Includes all dependencies in .md | Omitted or incomplete |
| **Fork Enabled** | Repo allows forking | “Fork” button active | Disabled |
| **Repository Organization** | Clear modular folder structure | src/, docs/, scripts/ folders organized | Flat or disordered repo |
| **Code Quality & Readability** | Naming, indentation, comments, linting | Clean, readable, follows style guide | Inconsistent or uncommented |
| **Deployability (Dockerization)** | docker-compose.yml launches full system | All services start with one command | Broken or partial setup |
| **Environment Config Safety** | .env.example used, no hardcoded secrets | Secrets externalized | Keys visible in source |

---

## **3. INTEGRATION & ECOSYSTEM FIT**

*How your project connects to and strengthens the BNB Chain ecosystem.*

| CRITERION | WHAT WE LOOK FOR | GOOD EXAMPLE (HIGH SCORE) | NEEDS IMPROVEMENT (LOW SCORE) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **On-Chain Deployment Evidence** | Verified smart contract on BscScan | Deployed & verified with link | Not deployed or irrelevant |
| **Smart Contract Integration** | BNB SDK / ethers.js / web3.js usage | Functional BNB SDK integration | No on-chain logic |
| **Ecosystem Composability** | Integration with Greenfield, opBNB, BEP tokens | Demonstrated interaction | Only mentioned conceptually |
| **Ecosystem Value Proposition** | How project strengthens BNB Chain | Clear, ecosystem-aligned use case | Generic or unrelated |

---

## **4. INNOVATION & CREATIVITY**

*What makes your idea stand out.*

| CRITERION | WHAT WE LOOK FOR | GOOD EXAMPLE (HIGH SCORE) | NEEDS IMPROVEMENT (LOW SCORE) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Problem–Solution Clarity** | Defined user problem and solution | Specific, data-supported problem framing | Vague or unclear challenge |
| **Technical Novelty** | Innovative algorithms or architecture | Unique or first-of-its-kind approach | Rehash of existing tech |
| **Use of Emerging Tech** | Creative use of AI, L2, modular design | Demonstrated integration | Surface-level mention |

---

## **5. SUSTAINABILITY & MARKET POTENTIAL**

*How your project can grow beyond the hackathon.*

| CRITERION | WHAT WE LOOK FOR | GOOD EXAMPLE (HIGH SCORE) | NEEDS IMPROVEMENT (LOW SCORE) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Target User & Market Fit** | Realistic audience & market timing | Addresses real, current pain point | Idea too early or unrealistic infra |
| **Business / Token Model** | Revenue or token utility | Logical token economics & incentives | No clear monetization plan |
| **Adoption & Growth Plan** | Strategy for users, partners, or community | Credible roadmap and partnerships | Missing or vague go-to-market |
| **Roadmap / Future Development** | Planned next steps | Detailed milestones & deliverables | Missing or generic statement |
